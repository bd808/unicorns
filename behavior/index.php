<h1>Behavior</h1>
<p>Unicorns a gentle, docile creatures, not aggressive, but that should not
fool someone into thinking that they cannot be aggressive. They generally
live in groups of four or five, and are as close as any family can be. The
group typically consists of an elder unicorn, one that may be hundreds of
years old, a lovestruck pair and one or perhaps two of their offspring.
Should one group meet another, it is joyful, happy time and the two may
travel together for a while before separating and continuing along
different paths.

<p>There are never power struggles of any sort between Unicorns as they
respect age and the experience that comes with it.

<p>Perhaps the only time that there may be aggression between two of the
animals is when a female reaches the age that she may find a partner. This
is supposed to take place at around thirty years of age. Males display the
trait that is so true amongst many species, the desire to have a mate, this
can result sometimes in fatal battles between suitors. Once a female has
found a partner, she will stay with him for life.

<p>Unicorns forage for food like other woodland creatures but they always
choose to live in areas with sustainable food supplies, including their
favorite food, lavender. The natural horns for which unicorns are so well
known are the primary basis for their defense from predators, but unicorns
are extremely elusive and secretive creatures, so they are rarely in a
position to be located and threatened. Like other hoofed animals, unicorns
rest and sleep while lying on the ground with their legs folded in against
the body, with the body tilted slightly toward one side and the head turned
back toward the rear This way, their legs are always almost directly under
them, allowing them to leap to their feet in an instant.
