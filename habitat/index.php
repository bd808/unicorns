<h1>Habitat</h1>
<p>Typically, unicorns live deep in the forest and are rarely seen by people.
Unicorns, like other walking creatures, live on the ground and do not
choose to reside in caves and certainly not in trees. Although many people
believe that unicorns primarily live in Europe, they are much more
widespread on the Earth. There are numerous unicorn traditions that
describe where they live and, like people, the appearance and even some
behaviors of unicorns differ depending on where they make their home.
Regardless of this, the natural surroundings for unicorns are heavily
wooded areas, though they may live near a seashore or occasionally in
mountainous areas. All of these locations must be remote and far from human
towns and cities.

<p>Nations that have confirmed communities of unicorns are Germany, China,
Japan, Persia, and Vietnam. In China, the unicorn is one of four sacred
animals that are the guardians of the hidden realms on the earth and places
beyond our own existence. Chinese unicorns are rarely seen by men or
associated with a specific region since they primarily exist other worldly
domains.

<p>In Germany, the legend of the Einhorn is associated with cult worship of
the adoration of the virgin. The Harz mountain region is where unicorns are
most likely to be found. In fact, there is a cave in this area which to
this day is called the Einhornhohle. It acquired its name from a story
which took place in the days when much of Germany was covered with dark,
unmapped forests, which were ruled by the old gods.

<p>Japanese unicorns can often take the form of the legendary Kirin. Like
unicorns in other regions, they are shy and rarely seen and thus are not
associated with a particular area in Japan.

<p>Unicorns in ancient Persia are thought to be extinct but were considered
more fierce and ferocius than those living in other parts of the world. It
was thought that a Persian unicorn had the strength to kill even an
elephant. This unicorn inhabited the grassy plains and deserts of India and
Persia, perhaps even extending to northeastern Africa, and whenever it
appeared it was greatly respected for its enormous strength and ferocity.

<p>Little is known about the unicorns in Vietnam. What we know is primarily
communicated by custom and ritual. In Vietnam, a yearly unicorn dance is
performed. The ritual occurs on the full moon of the eighth month, which is
the beginning of the monsoon season.

<p>The dance looks similar to the Chinese dragon dances. People put on masks
and costumes to conceal their identity. They tie an effigy of a unicorn up
onto a platform. Archers then shoot at it and sing the effigy song to
herald the rains.
