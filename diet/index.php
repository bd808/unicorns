      <h1>Diet</h1>
      <p>
      What do unicorns eat? It depends on who you ask. Unicorns have a widely varied diet, some of which makes them seem very civilized, and other food items which make them seem barbaric. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If you want to imagine unicorns as civilized, their favorite food is lavender. Other common foods for unicorns are fern shoots, soft mosses, herbs, flowers and tender young leaves are their staples in spring and summer. In the winter months, they have very limited diet feeding primarily on the bark of certain trees, lichens,mosses and the hardy shrub plants generally found in such areas. They have been known to lick certain rocks, cave faces, stalactites and stalagmites where there are nutrients to be found that supplement their diet. Minerals are important to the health and strength of unicorns, and are fortunately easily obtained.

      Unicorns of the forest and meadows have the widest variety of succulent diet ingredients to choose from and dine on berries and other fruits, ferns, seedheads, blossoms, buds, bark, soft leaves, fungi, farm crops, honey, and sap. In built up areas, they can occasionally be seen grazing on wildflowers, hedgerows and even over garden walls.

      That diet makes unicorns seem very peaceful and friendly. However, other authorities on unicorns have a different idea about what they actually eat. Shockingly, unicorns are said to eat the souls and blood of young children, ages 3-7. As most mythical creatures do, they consume these items with a side beverage of baby's tears, and the hopes and dreams of young lovers mixed together. Though slightly pungent the tears and hopes mixture does tend to wash down the meal.

      That makes unicorns seem a lot less appealing and parents would be unwise to allow their children to be in the presence of unicorns without proper supervision...that is unless you are planning on their untimely disappearance.
