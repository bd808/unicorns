<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>It is known that the eldest and wisest of the creatures are telepathic, and able to broadcast their thoughts and feelings to whomever they wish. Younger animals have a certain degree of empathy, being able to sense the emotions of people around them, and also able to communicate theirs.
<p>They all communicate with and learn from their elder brethren, the unicorns in the inner planes, just as we are privileged to do. 
<p>Dolphins and unicorns have a very close relationship, not only because they have the same planet of origin, but because they can communicate and exchange information, they can also interact through play.  No being is too evolved to enjoy pure fun.
